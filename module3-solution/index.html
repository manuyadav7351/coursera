                extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone 
                who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself,
                 because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain 
                 can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes 
                 laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right
                to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, 
                or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? [33] On the other hand,
                we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized
                y the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee 
                the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in 
                their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.
                These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power 
                of choice is untrammeled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best,
                every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances 
                and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur
                that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore
                always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to
                secure other greater pleasures,
                 or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains
